**Welcome to Swift!**

Swift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.
